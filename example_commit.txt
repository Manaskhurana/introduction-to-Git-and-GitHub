Provide a good commit message example

The purpose of this commit is to Provide an example of hand-crafted,
artisanal commit message. The first line is a short, approximately 50 characters
summary, followed by an empty line. the subsequent paragraphs are jam-packed
with descriptive information about the change, but each line is kept under 72
characters in length.

if even more information is needed to explain the change, more paragraphs can
be added after blank lines, with links to issues, tickets, or bugs. Remember
that future you will thank current you for your toughtfulness and foresight!

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
